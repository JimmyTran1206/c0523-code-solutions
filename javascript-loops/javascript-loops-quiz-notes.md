## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  Repeat a block of codes for a certian times without copying-pasting
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  **condition** states the continuing criteria for a loop. As long as the condition is true, the loops continues on. If the condition is false, the loop stops.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  "iteration" means a single-pass through all the codes within the body of the loop. In another word, an iteration is a single execution of the loop body. A loop sequence consists of many rounds of iteration

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  **condition** in the while-loop is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  **initialization** is evaluated only once at the beginning of the loop sequence.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  Similar to while-loop, **condition** in the for-loop is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration round.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  **final** expression in the for-loop is evaluated after the loop successfully complete each iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  Keyword `break`

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  Increase the value of the variable by 1

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  use for(let x in object){code blocks}
